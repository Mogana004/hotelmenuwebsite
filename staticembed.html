                <h1> Consistency and its importance </h1>
                <p> It requires a long-term commitment and sustained effort in doing actions repeatedly until you achieve your goals.
                    It can spell the difference between failure and success.<br />
                    Consistency leads to momentum.
                    The more consistently you do something, the easier it becomes, and the more momentum you build up.
                    Eventually, what was once a struggle becomes a habit, and habits are hard to break.
                    Consistency is the key to making lasting change.<br />

                    Being consistent means dedicating yourself to your goals and staying focused on the things and activities to achieve your goals.<br />
                    Consistency requires a long-term commitment from you and involves sustained effort in doing actions repeatedly until you achieve your goals.<br />

                    It can be tough to do it alone, so seek some guidance from other people, like a life coach, to help improve your way of doing things.<br />
